<h3>Orphan Counties: How some communities are not represented in their respective TV media market</h3>

<center><img src='dma-whole-1819.png'></center>

<section>
<p>This project came about from my interest in television history and the desire to read articles about the TV industry. I have read a lot of articles about the industry and have a lot of useless knowledge on the topic. In thinking about this project and topics, I stumbled across an article about Orphan Counties <a href="references.html#note1">(note 1)</a>.  While this is something that I’ve wondered about, specifically as it related to the Denver market - it is one of the most unique markets in the country - I’ve never really done a deep dive into the topic. This was my opportunity to dive more into this and hopefully learn more about how the Denver market came to be. While the makeup of the Denver market may take bit more intense research, I can at least dive into the more general topic of orphan counties, who their citizens are affected, and what can be done to help them better connect to their legal state of residence and the media that they consume and its impact on adequate voter information. </p>
